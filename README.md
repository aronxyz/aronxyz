## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Full-Stack Developer specialized in the React ecosystem**, including React, Next.js, TypeScript, and JavaScript.  
I work with Tailwind CSS and Sass, and stay up to date with the latest HTML and CSS standards.  

I'm especially attentive to **accessibility (a11y)** and inclusive design â€” an area I care deeply about as a developer who is hearing impaired.

On the backend, I have experience with Node.js (Express), Spring Boot, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.  
Currently exploring CMS platforms like WordPress and Shopify, as well as headless CMS solutions such as Sanity and Strapi.

Today, I'm leaning more toward the backend aspect of my full-stack profile, currently revisiting PHP (particularly Laravel) and C# with .NET.
