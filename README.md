## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Full-Stack Developer specialized in the React ecosystem**, including React, Next.js, TypeScript, and JavaScript.  
I work with Tailwind CSS and Sass, and stay up to date with the latest HTML and CSS standards.

I have a feel for and care deeply about user interfaces â€” having spent time studying **UX/UI principles** and working with design tools like **Figma** and **Illustrator**, with occasional use of **Photoshop**. I enjoy crafting intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing frontends that truly serve users.

I'm especially attentive to **accessibility (a11y)** and inclusive design â€” an area I care deeply about as a developer who is hearing impaired.

On the backend, I have experience with **Node.js (Express)**, **Spring Boot**, **MongoDB**, and **PostgreSQL**.  
I love designing databases and am genuinely interested in **system design**, architecture, and building scalable, maintainable solutions.

Currently, I'm exploring CMS platforms like **WordPress** and **Shopify**, as well as headless CMS options such as **Sanity** and **Strapi**.  
Today, Iâ€™m leaning more toward the backend side of my full-stack profile, revisiting **PHP (especially Laravel)** and **C# with .NET**.

Finally, I have a formal education as a **TÃ©cnico Superior en Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Web**.  
My native language is **Spanish**, but I studied in a **bilingual high school**, and I genuinely enjoy using **English** â€” it's my go-to language for learning and working.
