## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Full-Stack Developer specialized in the React ecosystem**, including React, Next.js, TypeScript, and JavaScript.  
I focus on building intuitive, high-performance user interfaces and seamless frontend experiences.

On the backend, I have experience with Node.js (Express), Spring Boot, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.  
Currently exploring CMS platforms like WordPress and Shopify, as well as headless CMS solutions such as Sanity and Strapi.

Today, I'm leaning more towards the backend aspect of my full-stack profile, currently revisiting PHP (particularly Laravel) and C# with .NET.
